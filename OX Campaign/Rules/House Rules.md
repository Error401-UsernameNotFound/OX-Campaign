#### Banned Content
- All content from *Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica*

#### Rules Changes
- When a *bag of holding* or similar magical item is placed inside the extradimensional space of another *bag of holding* or similar magical item, no rift is created. Instead, both extradimensional spaces are destroyed and their contents are scattered in the astral plane, but the surrounding area is unaffected.

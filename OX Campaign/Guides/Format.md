### File Hierarchy

1. Important! "\_" at the beginning is reserved for **main folders** that get accessed continuously for ease of use and stable location.
> ex: **\_World** 

2. **Non-text files** must be placed in a "**{Folder-name} files**" folder. This is to de-clutter folders that are actually used and make it easier to skim for what you want.
>ex. "**Monster Files**" = a folder holding both attachments to [[Empty Monster]]
### Files, Universal
at the top of the file you MUST place
a box that looks like this
```
Created by {Author}: {date}
```
In addition whenever you change a already created text file you must add the line
```
Modified by {Author2}: {date2}
```
so it looks like
```
Created by {Author}: {date}
Modified by {Author2}: {date2}
```
And so on

This allows us to trace changes easily and ask previous contributors questions about what they wrote if that were to come up.
